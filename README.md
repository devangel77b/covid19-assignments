# covid19-assignments
### D Evangelista, 2020
Backup assignments for people to do in case of COVID-19 school shutdown. 

## Assignment 1: Model an outbreak
The idea for this one is to try some SIR models in Matlab with and without various protective measures (represented by different parameter values), then to use the simulation results and any other research the student has done to make an informed policy recommendation to their chain of command. For this assignment, the students will also explore things like death rates and Ro. 

## Assignment 2: Draw a tree
Idea for this assignment is to draw a tree (phylogeny) and use it to understand the history of an outbreak, and to quantify important parameters. 

## Asssignment 3: Engineering solutions
Panic buying, hoarding, and price gouging have led to shortages of supplies that are acutely affecting those who must care for at-risk loved ones. This assignment will apply an engineering design process to the design of: (a) a donation point and supply chain for at-risk people; (b) manufacture and distribution of hand sanitizer; (c) design, manufacture, and distribution of masks; and (d) an effective public health messaging campaign.
